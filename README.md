ID Assignment 1 Submission
I designed this website to help increase my chances of being found as a freelance worker. The portfolio should aim to be simple, clean and aesthetically pleasing while not boring. The mood should be light and users should be able to interact with it for a fun and exciting experience.
The target audience are potential clients who would be interested in my works and this portfolio website should attract and show off some of the works in order to entice them into hiring me. This is because clients will be interested in seeing my skill and proficiency with the skills that I have stated. Thus functions such as the gallery would be very helpful in show casing my works. The skills section also gives off a rough estimation regarding my confidence and self-rated proficiency within the set of skills that I have. To do all this, the website has to be enticing and attractive, being able to show off one the skills that I have which would be html and css and a bit of javascript. The website also allows for potential clients to have a way to contact me through emails due to the contact me section.
